# REFLECTIONS.md

## Were your predictions right?
- Yes, they were what I expected.

## What surprised you?
- I realized that it's possible to extract specific data points more efficiently than I thought. It made me think there could be even shorter and cleaner ways to write the code than what I used.

## What was tricky or rewarding?
- Using `for` loops still takes some getting used to. I sometimes have to slow down and double-check the logic,
but it felt good when it finally worked.

## How did using your own data change things?
- It made me think about the importance of data validation, even I worked with my own data.
